Please consider the survey above. You are participating in a survey for your school, in which you are screened on whether the course in question was effective in meeting the specific objectives. In this survey, there are 2 ends of the range with the low end of the range being that the course did not meet the objectives or strongly disagree with the survey header. Inversely, the other end represents the sentiment that the course was effective in meeting the structured objectives. The administrators/intructors notified you that it would be anonymous meaning that users will not have to enter their name. When considering an ethical design for anything we do, and specifically in technology, we must understand that honesty is a major aspect of ethics. If we take a look closely at this scenario we see that there is a lack of transparency in the way the survey was carried out.
There are also other implications from this such as potentially relying on third party   organizations with students data, which would theoretically be a risk for privacy and potentiates the circumstance where other organizations can use the survey data against the institution in question. To combat this ethical problem, there can be several things done such as encrypting username/password to prevent any bias from the organization to a certain student base.  One could also stick to a institutional brightspace survey page, as it would keep the survey data secure. Let's assume however that this survey is considered fine by ethical and technical standards. As a hypothetical subordinate in this situation one could suggest a separate survey that approaches a distinct but similar goal. For instance, another survey could be made to survey what changes could be made if any to improve the course. This has a better chance to work as there is not any intervention towards the original survey. This will indirectly serve some ethical issues to the other survey. This tackles our problems content based issue but not technically. The latter is a bit more tricky to deal with if not given specific instructions or permission from higher-ups. One could assume that it would be better if approaching the employers in a perspective that follows the inert competition that our hypothetical insitution faces. For example, the aforementioned third-party publicity  can negatively effect the institution by increasing competitiveness in the field. This approach would have a better chance for change, in a way that does not alert the ethical problems but as a financial incentive. 




## Ethics in Data Science

The path to this recognition has been anything but easy. After years in the professional world, returning to formal education presented its own set of challenges. However, the decision to leave Chile nearly two years ago—leaving behind our families, friends, and everything familiar to start a new chapter in Canada—added another layer of complexity to this journey.
