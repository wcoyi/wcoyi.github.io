Please consider the survey below. You are participating in a survey for your school, in which you are screened on whether the course in question was effective in meeting the specific objectives. In this survey, there are 2 ends of the range with the low end of the range being that the course did not meet the objectives or strongly disagree with the survey header. Inversely, the other end represents the sentiment that the course was effective in meeting the structured objectives. The administrators/intructors notified you that it would be anonymous meaning that users will not have to enter their name. When considering an ethical design for anything we do, and specifically in technology, we must understand that honesty is a major aspect of ethics. If we take a look closely at this scenario we see that there is a lack of transparency in the way the survey was carried out.

## Ethics in Data Science

The path to this recognition has been anything but easy. After years in the professional world, returning to formal education presented its own set of challenges. However, the decision to leave Chile nearly two years ago—leaving behind our families, friends, and everything familiar to start a new chapter in Canada—added another layer of complexity to this journey.
