Receiving recognition for academic excellence from Air Canada during my graduation from the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning program at Collège LaSalle, Montréal has been an unforgettable and deeply emotional moment. This achievement represents not just academic success, but a testament to faith, family support, and perseverance.

## The Journey

The path to this recognition has been anything but easy. After years in the professional world, returning to formal education presented its own set of challenges. However, the decision to leave Chile nearly two years ago—leaving behind our families, friends, and everything familiar to start a new chapter in Canada—added another layer of complexity to this journey.


## The Support System

This recognition is not mine alone. It belongs to:

- My wife and children, who have stood by me every step of the way
- My parents and siblings in Chile, whose support transcended distance
- The faculty at Collège LaSalle, Montréal
- My classmates, whose dedication and hard work inspired me daily
- Special thanks to Emile Dufour, Lyne Tremblay, and Elisa Schaeffer

## The Role of Faith

Throughout this journey, there were moments when the challenges seemed insurmountable. It was in these moments that I experienced the sustaining power of God's love most clearly. The decision to move to Canada was not just a career move—it was a step of faith, and God has been faithful every step of the way.

## Looking Forward

As I move forward into my internship at Fireraven, I do so with:

- Renewed strength and joy
- A heart full of gratitude
- The support of an outstanding team
- The confidence that comes from overcoming challenges
- The knowledge that the best is yet to come

## Lessons Learned

This journey has taught me valuable lessons about:

1. The importance of family support in achieving goals
2. The power of faith in overcoming obstacles
3. The value of stepping out of your comfort zone
4. The importance of surrounding yourself with the right people
5. The rewards of perseverance and hard work

## Gratitude

I want to express my deepest gratitude to:

- Air Canada for this meaningful honor
- Collège LaSalle, Montréal for the excellent education
- My family for their unwavering support
- My friends and colleagues for their encouragement
- God for His constant presence and guidance

This recognition is not just an end—it's a beginning. As I continue my journey in the field of AI and Machine Learning, I carry with me the lessons learned, the relationships built, and the faith that has sustained me through it all.

The best is indeed yet to come.
